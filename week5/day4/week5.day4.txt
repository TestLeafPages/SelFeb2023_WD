 Todays Agenda:
==============
   09:30-10:30->Hooks Implementation
   10:30-11:05->Classroom+Break
   11:05-11:45->Tags
   11:45-12:00->Classroom
   12:00-12:30-> Java Keywords
  
  

  what is Hooks?
  Initially is cucumber was develop by Ruby language

cucumber annotation


Hooks Implementation:
=====================
   @Before - To have the common pre conditions
   @After - To have the post conditions 
   

Tags- used to categorize the test scenarois


Steps:
=======
  1)Write feature file for CreateLead
  2)Pass multiple data for createLead using Scenario Outline
  3)Write StepDefintion for CreateLead
  4)Create BaseClass and put all the pre conditions(Launch,Load url) using @BeforeMethod,AfterMethod
  5)StepdDefinitions should extend BaseClass
  6)Runner class should extend BaseClass
  7)BaseClass should extend AbstractTestNGCucumberTests  


Java keywords
this
=====
its current class
this driver=driver
//1st driver=local
//2nd driver=globally


super:
======
  ->It is a keyword
  ->It can be achieved only if the parentclass is inherited
  ->It is used call a method from super class

Classroom:
===========
   ->Call seatBelt method from Car class using super keyword in Audi class
   ->Override handBrake() and try to call that     


Constructor:
============
   Constructor is the initial way to instantiate an object->It will initialize the state of an object-
Types:
======
   Default Constructor
   Parameterized Constructor 
Constructor chaining:
=====================
 -this keyword  
 -It is used to call one constructor from another constructor 
 -Can we call one constructor from another constructor  
 -Constructor call should be the first statement of your constructor
 

 
static:
=======
    Object creation is not required.
	If you update the static data it will override the oldvalue with new value
  
variables
method
block of code
