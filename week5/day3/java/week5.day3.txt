   TDD - Test Driven Development
------------------------------
- Write the testcases first
- Get the approval for the testcases
- Development should be based on the testcases

Cons:
- Lot of negative testcases covered rather than positive testcases

ATTD - Acceptance Test Driven Development:
------------------------------------------
- Write the acceptance testcases first
- Develop the software based on the acceptance testcases

Cons:
 - Communication gap between the Technical and non technical team
 
 
BDD - Behaviour Driven Development:
-----------------------------------
- To address the communication gap between tech and non tech team

- Write acceptance testcases first using common language
	- common language: understandable by both and tech and non tech team
