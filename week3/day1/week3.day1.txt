10.55to 11.35--Classroom + Break
11.35 to 12.20--Polymorphism
12.20 to 12.35--Classroom
12.35 to 12.45--Recap




OOPs concept
=============

--Inheritance
--Polymorphism
--Abstraction
--Encapsulation

keyword: extends
gf - f ---single level or simple inheritance

gf- f-son -----mutilevel inheritance







Polymorphism in Java:
=====================

Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. 
The word “poly” means many, and “morphs” means forms. So, Polymorphism means many forms.

poly- many
morphs- forms


Types of Polymorphism in Java
----------------------------
Method overloading:
===================
Static polymorphism / Compile-time polymorphism/early binding/Static Binding

** when 2 or more method inside the same class
method name will be same but different input arguments
** Have same signature expect the input argument

eg:
class{
 public void add(int a,int b)
syso

public void add(int a,int b,int c)
syso(a+b+c)
}
========================
public void add(int a,int b)----->we cannot  able use it 
========================



Method overriding:
=================
Dynamic polymorphism / Runtime polymorphism/ late binding/dynamic binding

** when 2 or more same method are within different classes
but inherited  between them
and the signature same
but the logic is different

Ex: inheritance -->with same method name in
