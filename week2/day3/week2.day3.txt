 Xpath:
======
            It is used to locate the elements if the other locators are not present/same/different 
            Index starts with 1
Xpath- Xml path
 1. Absolute xPath
        - It starts with '/'
        - tagName is mandatory
        - start from pydoc import pager
from root tag
        - index for xPath starts with 1

/html/body/div[2]/div[2]/div/form/p/input
    - when new tag is introduces, xPath breaks
    - Difficult to write

    2. Relative xPath
        - It starts with '//'
        - tagName is mandatory


 How to handle dropdown:
   ======================
     1)Right Click ->Inspect the dropdown-
     2)Find whether that elment is inside a select tag  
     3)Create an object for Select Class and pass the WebElement inside the Constructor
     4)Using the object of the Select Class->Use any of these three methods 
         -selectByIndex()
         -selectByValue()
         -selectByVisibleText()




Implicitly Wait:
-----------------
- Its a common wait for all the locators in my script (findElement & findElements)			
- It is used to avoid the NoSuchElementException when the element is loaded little late
- If the element is loaded within the given time limit, it will locate element immediately and 
  proceed with next step in the script
- If the element is not loaded within the given time limit, it will throw NoSuchElementException
- Best practice is, apply ImplicitlyWait at the starting of your script
