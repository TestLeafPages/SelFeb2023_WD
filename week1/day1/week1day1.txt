 Class: A testcase java file where you write a logic
 
 * A class is a user defined blue print or templates
 
 what can be inside a class? 
 constructor,method,variable,object.
 
 class name started with uppercase

what is method?
 
 Method is a smaller line of code that does some specific operations/action
 
 name convention is starting with lowercase following word should be in uppercase

 }
 public ---Access modifier ---Specifics who can access
 void   ---Return type---output of method
 maxMark ---name--name of the method
 ()-input arguments----0,1,2,....n







What is object?
       its an instance classname
 
 1. create an object for classname
 2. call the method using the object
 
 syntax: classname objectname= new classname();
 
 new--> is keyword 
 
 classname()-- constructor
 
 objectname.method1();
 ====================================================
 
 variable-Name convention starting lowercase following uppercase
 int maxMark=45;
 //it can access in method alone
